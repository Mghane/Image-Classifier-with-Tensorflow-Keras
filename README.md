# Image-Classifier-with-Tensorflow-Keras
### Udacity final project for deep learning part of the Machine Learning with Tensorflow Nanodegree

This is the final project for deep learning with tensorflow as part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. In this project, we trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using Tensorflow and Keras. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice we trained this classifier, then exported it for use in our application. We used [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) from Oxford of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. 



The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load the image dataset and create a pipeline for transfer and processing.
* Build and Train an image classifier on this dataset.
* Use the transfer learning technique to improve accuracy.
* Use the trained model to perform inference on flower images.
